        <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
        <p>I started my programming journey in the beginning of 2020.
        I had thought that it would be difficult to learn but with 
        the help of many available free apps and youtube videos I 
        have been able to learn. I have a very analytical mind which
        I believe I had acquired from playing board games as a child. 
        I love to solve problems and identify patterns. When I was 
        introduced in the machining industry what interested me most
        was learning the code in order to program. Now that I see what 
        I can create online I have made it my mission to advance my skills 
        in programming software for either websites or mobile apps.
        I would like to gain experience within this industry and 
        want to work with a team to be able to create amazing things.</p>
